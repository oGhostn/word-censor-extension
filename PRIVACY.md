Privacy Policy — Word Censors
Word Censors is a Chrome Extension designed to censor certain words on webpage content.

What We Collect
We do not collect or store any personal information (such as your name, email, phone number, or financial transactions).

We do not track your browsing habits or network activity.

Why We Do It
All operations are performed directly in your browser.

We do not send any data back to a server — the main purpose is simply to find and replace words on the webpage you’re currently viewing.

How It Works
The extension temporarily parses the webpage’s text and performs substitutions in real time.

Once you navigate away or close the page, all modifications disappear and nothing is kept.

Third-Party Sharing
We do not share any data with 3rd parties — everything stays within your own browser.
